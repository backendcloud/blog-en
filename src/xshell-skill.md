# Paste

For example, openstack vm_id:

	424288e4-23a7-45de-bb5d-742bd6c54561

If the default delimiter is used, double-clicking can only select a part, you need to press and hold the mouse to drag, or more or less, or it will take a little time.

After changing the settings:

In the "Keyboard and Mouse" tab of "Options"

1. Remove the "-" in the delimiter.
2. Check "Automatically copy the selected text to the clipboard" and vm_id can be selected by double-clicking. There is no need to select copy and paste. It has been copied at the same time as it is selected. At this time, only the middle mouse button is needed to complete the paste.
