# What is Widget
Widget is not a small app, it is a new form of desktop content presentation, mainly used to make up for the main application's inability to display the data that users care about in time.

An excellent Widget needs to have three characteristics: simple and clear (Glanceable), appropriate display (Relevant), and personalized customization (Personalized).
