# Huawei and China's telecom operators

Over the past few decades, operators such as Huawei and China's telecom operators have reached a long-term tacit understanding, that is, operators are responsible for operations, and Huawei provides solutions, equipment, and technologies. 

With the development of the times and the popularity of open source, technical barriers have been broken, and operators have also started to develop technology. Operators first broke this harmony, cut off Huawei's financial resources, and gave priority to internal procurement when bidding, destroying the rules of fair competition. Huawei is not a vegetarian either. It also does what operators do, starting a public cloud.

In the past, Huawei did not participate in the operation of the public cloud. Huawei originally wanted to make money from technology, while operators made money from operations. Huawei's technology and global resources are by no means comparable to ordinary companies or even operators. There is nothing Huawei can't do if it wants to do something. As long as Huawei can do it, you need to know how many opponents Huawei has already put down in today's technology-heavy world.
